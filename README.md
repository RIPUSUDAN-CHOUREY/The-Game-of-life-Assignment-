# The-Game-of-life-Assignment-
In this repo I have created a Game named Game of life where the life and death of different cells occur at a tick(time-span) , and one can see the next-generation of cells also which consists of newly born and recently dead cell , it's more off like a game that computer plays not for the user to play . User can only decide the number rows and column.
